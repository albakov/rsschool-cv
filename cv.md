I'm PHP backend developer with 5 years experience. I think programming is about permanent education. 
So I try to learning something new every day. I appreciate responsibility and punctuality in people, 
so I try to match to it.

#### Skills
* PHP, JS (especially jQuery), Java (Android app development), SQL, HTML/CSS
* For web development/REST API I use Laravel
* For some lightweight websites I prefer using Wordpress/OpenCart
* Also I use many other technologies such as Memcached/Redis, Websockets, WebRTC and etc

#### Experiences
* I have finished many different projects: from landing pages to shops and services
* I have worked with Sphinx for fast searching in BigData (more than 10 million records)
* I have experience in Android development from scratching to publishing in Google Play Market
* I have created an online shop and CRM for medical company

#### Education
I have finished Academy of Civil Aviation in 2013 with specification "Aviation machinery and equipment".

I got involved with computers at 14. I created animation in Flash, websites in Dreamweaver, and wrote HTML 
in Windows Notepad. Mostly I studied by myself: read documentation, took online courses on specific topics, 
and practiced a lot.

#### English
My current level is pre-intermediate. I read a lot of documentation in english every day, 
watch films and listen to podcasts in english too. 
I want to speak with somebody in English this is my goal at nearest future.
